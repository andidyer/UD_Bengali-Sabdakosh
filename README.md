# Summary

UD_Bengali-Sabdakosh is a corpus parsed sentences from contemporary Bengali prose, consisting of passages of up to 50 sentences from modern fiction.

# Introduction

The name _Sabdakosh_ is a Bengali word for a collection of literature: somewhere between an anthology and a bookshelf.
The corpus is composed of spans of 50 sentences each from a collection of contemporary literature from both India and Bangladesh, parsed according to Universal Dependencies annotation.
Annotation is performed on (arborator.grew.fr)[Arborator] and assembled here.

As of the time of writing (1015-04-19) the treebank passes level 3 of Universal Dependencies validation. Final work on documentation and annotation checks are pending before the data can be included in the Universal Dependencies release.
